        Giving money to those in need can be a personally satisfying experience,
        but there is a choice between donating nationally and internationally
        through charities or giving directly to those around you. This essay
        will consider the merits of both approaches.

            Hunger is still one the biggest - and most solvable - problems in
            the world. We have already made incredible progress: there are 300
            million fewer hungry people now than in the 90's. It is possible to
            end hunger. WFP is working for that every second of the day, feeding
            over 95 million people in urgent need and implementing programmes
            that tackle the causes of hunger. But this work depends on the
            support of people like you.
